Текст (ткань; сплетение, сочетание) — зафиксированная на каком-либо материальном носителе человеческая мысль; в общем плане связная и полная последовательность символов.Hello.

Существуют две основные трактовки понятия «текст»: имманентная (расширенная, философски нагруженная) и репрезентативная (более частная). Имманентный подход подразумевает отношение к тексту как к автономной реальности, нацеленность на выявление его внутренней структуры. Репрезентативный — рассмотрение текста как особой формы представления информации о внешней тексту действительности.

В лингвистике термин «текст» используется в широком значении, включая и образцы устной речи. Восприятие текста изучается в рамках лингвистики текста и психолингвистики. Так, например, И. Р. Гальперин определяет текст следующим образом: «Это письменное сообщение, объективированное в виде письменного документа, состоящее из ряда высказываний, объединённых разными типами лексической, грамматической и логической связи, имеющее определённый модальный характер, прагматическую установку и соответственно литературно обработанное»[1].
Текст, в своем роде, состоит из некоторого количества предложений. Одно предложение, даже очень распространённое, сложное, текстом назвать нельзя, поскольку текст можно разделить на самостоятельные предложения, а части предложения сочетаются по законам синтаксиса сложного предложения, но не текста.

Главный тезис — текст состоит из двух или более предложений.
В смысловой цельности текста отражаются те связи и зависимости, которые имеются в самой действительности (общественные события, явления природы, человек, его внешний облик и внутренний мир, предметы неживой природы и т. д.).

Единство предмета речи — это тема высказывания. Тема — это смысловое ядро текста, конденсированное и обобщённое содержание текста.

Понятие «содержание высказывания» связано с категорией информативности речи и присуще только тексту. Оно сообщает читателю индивидуально-авторское понимание отношений между явлениями, их значимости во всех сферах придают ему смысловую цельность.

В большом тексте ведущая тема распадается на ряд составляющих подтем; подтемы членятся на более дробные, на абзацы (микротемы).

Завершённость высказывания связана со смысловой цельностью текста. Показателем законченности текста является возможность подобрать к нему заголовок, отражающий его содержание.

Таким образом, из смысловой цельности текста вытекают следующие признаки текста:
How I Spend My Free Time

In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities. On the weekends, I often spend time with my friends, either by going to the mall or out to eat. I also enjoy playing sports, such as soccer or basketball, and participating in outdoor activities, such as hiking or going to the beach.
In addition to spending time with friends and being active, I also enjoy reading and watching movies or TV shows. I usually reserve this activity for when I have a little more free time, such as on a rainy day or after finishing all of my homework.

Another activity that I enjoy doing in my free time is volunteering. I find it fulfilling to give back to my community and help those in need. I have participated in various volunteering events, such as cleaning up a local park or helping out at a food bank.

Overall, I try to balance my free time with a mix of social activities, physical activity, and personal interests. By doing this, I can relax and enjoy my free time, while also staying active and engaged in my community.

How I spent my summer

This summer, I had the opportunity to take a break from school and enjoy my vacation. I decided to spend most of my time resting at home and spending time with my family.
One of the highlights of my summer was going on a road trip with my family. We traveled to several cities and visited a variety of tourist attractions, including amusement parks, national parks, and museums. It was a great opportunity to have fun.

In addition to the road trip, I also spent a lot of time outdoors. I went swimming in the pool, played football with my friends, and even went camping for the first time. The fresh air and physical activity were a welcome break from the school year, and I returned to school feeling ready for the new academic year.

Despite all the fun I had, I also made sure to use my summer vacation to catch up on some of the work I had fallen behind on during the school year. I spent a few hours each day reviewing my notes and completing assignments, so that I would be well-prepared for the upcoming school year.

To sum it up, my summer vacation was a great balance of relaxation and productivity. I am grateful for the opportunity to take a break from school and spend time with my family, and I am excited to return to school and start the new academic year.

Choosing a higher education path is always hard. You need to make sure that you study something you like and you really want to make a career in this field. I am going to tell you about my university, and why I chose it.

Right now, I am studying Business Administration and Management program at the faculty of Economics. It lasts for 3 years, and when I finish it I will get a bachelor’s degree. After that, I am planning to apply for a master’s degree which is 2 more years. I study for this degree at the University of Pecs. It is a huge University with many campuses and dormitories. I am not a freshman; I am a sophomore. That is why I already know a lot of things about higher education. At the beginning of each semester, you have to enroll in your course. After that you register for the compulsory and optional subjects. You can choose from a great number of elective courses. You can do absolutely anything from yoga to programming If you choose to. After you finish your studies, you can calculate your GPA, it is the average of your marks during the semester. If you have it above 4, you can apply for different scholarships and grants.

Studying at the university is so much fun because you meet a lot of unique people. But do not think it is easy. Only the best graduates receive jobs at international companies, so take your time and study hard. During your education, it is a good idea to apply for different internships to get some valuable experience.

Overall, university is a nice place to be in, and I hope you will get to your dream university, and after that you will get your dream job.

A PIECE OF ADVICE
Part 1
It is a dangerous thing to order the lives of others and I have often wondered at the self-confidence of the politicians, reformers and suchlike who are prepared to force upon their fellows measures that must alter their manners, habits, and points of view. I have always hesitated to give advice, for how can one advise another how to act unless one knows that other as well as one knows himself? Heaven knows. I know little enough of myself: I know nothing of others. We can only guess at the thoughts and emotions of our neighbours. Each one of us is a prisoner in a solitary tower and he communicates with the other prisoners, who form mankind, by conventional signs that have not quite the same meaning for them as for himself.
And life, unfortunately, is something that you can lead but once; mistakes are often irreparable and who am I that I should tell this one and that how he should lead it? Life is a difficult business and I have found it hard enough to make my own a complete and rounded thing; I have not been tempted to teach my neighbour what he should do with his. But there are men who flounder at the journey's start, the way before them is confused and hazardous and on occasion, however unwillingly, I have been forced to point the finger of fate. Sometimes men have said to me, what shall I do with my life? and I have seen myself for a moment wrapped in the dark cloak of Destiny.
Part 2
Once I know that I advised well.
I was a young man, and 1 lived in a modest apartment in London near Victoria Station. Late one afternoon, when I was beginning to think that I had worked enough for that day, I heard a ring at the bell. I opened the door to a total stranger. He asked me my name; I told him. He asked if he might come in.
"Certainly." 130
I led him into my sitting-room and begged him to sit down. He seemed a trifle embarrassed. I offered him a cigarette and he had some difficulty in lighting it without letting go off his hat. When he had satisfactorily achieved this feat I asked him if I should not put it on a chair for him. He quickly did this and while doing it dropped his umbrella.
"I hope you don't mind my coming to see you like this," he said. "My name is Stephens and I am a doctor. You're in the medical, I believe?"
"Yes, but I don't practise."
"No, I know. I've just read a book of yours about Spain and I wanted to ask you about it."
"It's not a very good book, I'm afraid." "The fact remains that you know something about Spain and there's no one else I know who does. And I thought perhaps you wouldn't mind giving me some information." "I shall be very glad."


He was silent for a moment. He reached out for his hat and holding it in one hand absent-mindedly stroked it with the other. I surmised that it gave him confidence.
"I hope you won't think it very odd for a perfect stranger to talk to you like this." He gave an apologetic laugh. "I'm not going to tell you the story of my life."
When people say this to me I always know that it is precisely what they are going to do. I do not mind. In fact I rather like it.
"I was brought up by two old aunts. I've never been anywhere. I've never done anything. I've been married for six years. I have no children. I'm a medical officer at the Camberwell Infirmary. I can't stick it any more."
There was something very striking in the short, sharp sentences he used. They had a forcible ring. I had not given him more than a cursory glance, but now I looked at him with curiosity. He was a little man, thick-set and stout, of thirty perhaps; with a round red face from which shone small, dark and very bright eyes. His black hair was cropped close to a bullet-shaped head. He was dressed in a blue suit a good deal the worse for wear. It was baggy at the knees and the pockets bulged untidily.


"You know what the duties are of a medical officer in an infirmary. One day is pretty much like another. And that's all I've got to look forward to for the rest of my life. Do you think it's worth it?"
"It's a means of livelihood," I answered.
"Yes. I know. The money's pretty good."
"I don't exactly know why you've come to me."
"Well, I wanted to know whether you thought there would be any chance for an English doctor in Spain?"
"Why Spain?"
"I don't know, I just have a fancy for it."
"It's not like Carmen, you know."
"But there's sunshine there, and there's good wine, and there's colour, and there's air you can breathe. Let me say what I have to say straight out. I heard by accident that there was no English doctor in Seville. Do you think I could earn a living there? Is it madness to give up a good safe job for an uncertainty?"
"What does your wife think about it?"
"She's willing."
"It's a great risk."
"I know. But if you say take it, I will; if you stay where you are, I'll stay."
He was looking at me intently with those bright dark eyes of his and I knew that he meant what he said I reflected for a moment.


"Your whole future is concerned: you must decide for yourself. But this I can tell you: if you don't want money but are content to earn just enough to keep body and soul together, then go. For you will lead a wonderful life."
He left me, I thought about him for a day or two, and then forgot. The episode passed completely from my memory.
Part 3 Many years later, fifteen at least, I happened to be in Seville and having some trifling; indisposition asked the hotel porter whether there was an English doctor in the town. He said there was and gave me the address. I took a cab and as I drove up to 132
the house a little fat man came out of it. He hesitated when he caught sight of me.
"Have you come to see me?" he said. "I'm the English
doctor."
I explained my errand and he asked me to come in. He lived in an ordinary Spanish house, with a patio, and his consulting room which led out of it littered with papers, books, medical appliances, and lumber. The sight of it would have startled a squeamish patient. We did our business and then I asked the doctor what his fee was. He shook his head and smiled.
"There's no fee."
"Why on earth not?"
"Don't you remember me? Why, I'm here because of something you said to me. You changed my whole life for me. I'm Stephens."
I had not the least notion what he was talking about. He reminded me of our interview, he repeated to me what we had said, and gradually, out of the night, a dim recollection of the incident came back to me.
"I was wondering if I'd ever see you again," he said, "I was wondering if ever I'd have a chance of thanking you for all you've done for me."
"It's been a success then?"
I looked at him. He was very fat now and bald, but his eyes twinkled gaily and his fleshy, red face bore an expression of perfect good-humour. The clothes he wore, terribly shabby they were, had been made obviously by a Spanish tailor and his hat was the wide-brimmed sombrero of the Spaniard. He looked to me as though he knew a good bottle of wine when he saw it. He had a dissipated though entirely sympathetic, appearance. You might have hesitated to let him remove your appendix, but you could not have imagined a more delightful creature to drink a glass of wine with.
"Surely you were married?" I asked.
"Yes. My wife didn't like Spain, she went back to Camberwell, she was more at home there."
"Oh, I'm sorry for that."
His black eyes flashed a bacchanalian smile. He really had somewhat the look of a young Silenus.
"Life is full of compensations", he murmured.
The words were hardly out of his mouth when a Spanish woman, no longer in her first youth, but still boldly and voluptuously beautiful, appeared at the door. She spoke to him in Spanish, and I could not fail to perceive that she was the mistress of the house.
As he stood at the door to let me out he said to me: "You told me when last I saw you that if I came here I should earn just enough money to keep body and soul together, but that I should lead a wonderful life. Well, I want to tell you that you were right. Poor I have been and poor I shall always be, but by heaven I've enjoyed myself. I wouldn't exchange the life I've had with that of any king in the world."
